## Few-shot Image Classification for Breast Cancer Detection

Breast cancer is a pressing concern worldwide, ranking as the second leading cause of cancer death in women~\citep{miller2022cancer}. Fortunately, early detection and identification of breast cancer can lead to timely treatment, effectively reducing the risk of further deterioration or death. Breast ultrasound image classification serves as a primary method for such detection. However, traditional medical image classification often demands considerable human expertise and time, making it impractical for many underdeveloped countries and regions. Hence, there has been a shift towards pattern recognition and machine learning approaches to automate and streamline medical image classification and breast cancer detection. Numerous learning-based methods, ranging from traditional machine learning to modern deep learning, have been proposed.
